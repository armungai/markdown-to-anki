# Markdown To Anki
The goal with this project is to over-engineer a simple topic to hopefully learn about said technologies I am going to over-engineer with

**The MVP I am aiming for will:**
- Take as input 1 (or more) markdown files (.md)
- Process markdown into an Anki-exportable form
- Allow user to download file

**First Iteration 5/08/25**
- got a page that serves the static page
- `go run main.go`
